# KMeans-Clustering
The K-means Web App is a user-friendly tool that allows you to generate random data and apply the K-means clustering algorithm to it. Additionally, it provides two methods, the Elbow method and the Silhouette method, to help you determine the optimal value of K for your dataset.

## Introduction
K-means clustering is a popular machine learning technique used for grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities. This web application simplifies the process of data generation and K-means clustering, making it accessible to both beginners and experts.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Generation**
   - Click the "Generate Data" button to create a sample dataset.
   - Customize the number of data points, dimensions, and clusters.
   
2. **K-means Clustering**
   - Apply the K-means algorithm to your generated data by clicking the "Run K-means" button.
   - Visualize the results with color-coded clusters on the interactive plot.
   
3. **Optimal K Selection**
   - Use the "Elbow Method" and "Silhouette Method" options to find the optimal value of K for your data.
   - The optimal K value will be displayed along with a visualization of the selected method's results.
